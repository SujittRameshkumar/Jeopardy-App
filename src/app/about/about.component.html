  <p>Jeopardy! is an American television game show created by Merv Griffin. The show features a quiz competition in which contestants are presented with general knowledge clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions.

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I attend The Ohio State University and I am majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I have gained experience using Angular at my most recent internship at Huntington Bank where I was a front end developer.</p>

  <h2>The Project</h2>
  <p>The web app was built using Angular 8 in Microsoft Visual Studios Code. I felt that Angular would give the best combination of functionality and an appealing UI. Additionally, Angular websites are mobile friendly.</p>
